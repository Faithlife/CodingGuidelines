# Kotlin Coding Guidelines

Follow the [official coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html) with minimal deviations.

## Enforcement

[ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/) is used to enforce style checks. It supports a large subset of the official coding guidelines, but aspires to support the complete set.
