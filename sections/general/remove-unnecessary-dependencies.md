# Remove Unnecessary Dependencies

When a previously used dependency is no longer necessary, it should be removed. This guideline has many applications, including:

* Remove unused library references from projects
* Remove unused references in source code (`using` directives in C#, `import`s in JavaScript, etc.)
* [Delete Unused Code](delete-unused-code.md)
